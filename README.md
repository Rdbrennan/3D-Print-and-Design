# Weclome to my 3D Print and Design work 

Goal: To learn core browser programming with flexbox, media queries, javascript events and visual effects with CSS. 


# Projects

### Project 1 - Red Red Wine Design

  </p>

Things I learned:

  ● The underlying architecture to build 3D objects
  
  ● How to properly fill the object and leave no "gaps" for printing
  
#

### Project 2 - Spoon Design

<p align="center">

  </p>
  
Things I learned:

  ● How to solve printing challenges (The spoon in particular would have too much support under the curve where the user would hold it, so I decided to print the spoon upside down)
  
#

### Project 3 - Coffee Mug Design

<p align="center">
<img align="center" width="850" height="500" src="https://github.com/Rdbrennan/3D-Print-and-Design/blob/master/Automaker%20Monkey%20Design/Screen%20Shot%202018-09-20%20at%2012.15.26%20AM.png">
  </p>
  
Things I learned:

  ● The challenge with the coffee mug was that the handle sticking out needed to be close enough to where it did not need support all the way from the bottom of the printing plate, but also that there was a big enough gap that a person could hold it like a regular coffee mug. It took many iterations but the it came out succesfully.

### Project 4 - Name Design

<p align="center">
<img align="center" width="850" height="500" src="https://github.com/Rdbrennan/3D-Print-and-Design/blob/master/Automaker%20Monkey%20Design/Screen%20Shot%202018-09-20%20at%2012.21.09%20AM.png">
  </p>
  
Things I learned:

  ● How to manipulate text and bend it to the object at hand
  
#

### Project 5 - Emblem Keychain Design

<p align="center">
<img align="center" width="850" height="500" src="https://github.com/Rdbrennan/3D-Print-and-Design/blob/master/Automaker%20Monkey%20Design/Screen%20Shot%202018-09-20%20at%2012.17.17%20AM.png">
  </p>
  
Things I learned:

  ● To take a photo and render it onto blende
  
  ● Trace over an object that is rendered and turn into a 3D object
  
#

### Project 6 - Automaker Nintendo Controller

<p align="center">
<img align="center" width="850" height="500" src="https://github.com/Rdbrennan/3D-Print-and-Design/blob/master/Automaker%20Monkey%20Design/Screen%20Shot%202018-09-20%20at%2012.18.34%20AM.png">
  </p>
  
Things I learned:

  ● How to use the Autocad application to take a set of photos to render into a 3D object
  
  ● To patch up rendered photos and make sure that they are filled in
  
#

### Project 7 (Final) - Automaker Robot Design

<p align="center">
<img align="center" width="850" height="500" src="https://github.com/Rdbrennan/3D-Print-and-Design/blob/master/Automaker%20Monkey%20Design/Screen%20Shot%202018-09-20%20at%2012.19.41%20AM.png">
  </p>
  
Things I learned:

  ● The challenge with the final design was to have a moving part that also connected to the rest of the object (I solved this by having two rotatable arms on the robot. I made two spheres, one larger one smaller. I put the smaller sphere inside the larger and left enough space for support. Once the design was printed, I simply wiggled the arm until the support broke inside the larger sphere leaving two rotatable arms).
